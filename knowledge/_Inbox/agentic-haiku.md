[The author shares why Claude Code (CC)](https://minusx.ai/blog/decoding-claude-code/)—from Anthropic—is such a delightful and effective AI coding agent, even outperforming rivals like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, thanks to deliberate simplicity and strong tooling.

## Keep It Simple

CC avoids complex multi-agent orchestration and multi-threaded systems. There’s one main control loop with at most one branching sub-agent—making the system debuggable and maintainable.

## Make Smart Use of Models

A smaller model (e.g., Claude 3.5 Haiku) handles majority of tasks such as file reading, summarization, or labeling—making operations cost-effective, fast, and efficient.

## Build a Strong Prompting System

Detailed prompts include heuristics, tone/style guidance, tool usage policies, environment details, commit history, etc. Use a persistent configuration/context file (e.g. claude.md) that’s embedded with every interaction to maintain user preferences and codebase-specific rules.

## Tooling: Simple, Structured, and Clear

CC replaces RAG with LLM-driven search using conventional tools like ripgrep, find, jq—more reliable and simpler. Offers a hierarchy of tools:

| Level | Example Tools | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low-level | bash, read, write | Raw file manipulation |
| Mid-level | edit, grep, glob | Common operations for ease |
| High-level | task, web_fetch, exit_plan_mode | Higher abstraction actions |
Tool descriptions in prompts include clear guidance on when and how to use them, preventing confusion.

## Focus on Steerability and Clarity

Prompts enforce tone, style, and task flow. Design algorithms with heuristics and concrete examples (the “PLEASE THIS IS IMPORTANT” style is still a practical way to emphasize priority).

## Agent Configuration Template: “Claude-Inspired Agent”

Use this template to build your own agentic LLM system with clarity, simplicity, and robustness in mind.

## Main Control Loop

```
LOOP:
- Receive user input
- Preprocess if needed
- Decide: direct completion, use tool(s), or spawn a single sub-agent
- If sub-agent: 
  → Provide context & tasks
  → Await result (only one branch permitted)
- Process response
- Update message history
- Return result to user
END LOOP
```


## Model Strategy

Use a small model (e.g., “Haiku”/lightweight variant) for: 
- Reading, summarization, simple parsing
- Label generation / classification
Reserve a larger model for complex planning or edits. Track usage to optimize cost vs performance.

## Persistent Context & Preferences (agent.md)

Store user/team preferences, style rules, file ignore patterns, conventions, etc. Always inject this file into every user interaction.

## Prompt Design

Structure your system prompt to include: 
- Tone & Style guidelines
- Steerability rules (“Use XML tags”, naming conventions, urgency markers)
- Tool connection policies (when to call which tool)
- Environment context: date, working directory, platform, recent commits
- Plenty of heuristics + examples for tasks

## Tools Architecture

Define tools across three layers:

| Level | Example Tools | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low-level | bash, read, write | Raw file manipulation |
| Mid-level | edit, grep, glob | Common operations for ease |
| High-level | task, web_fetch, exit_plan_mode | Higher abstraction actions |
Make each tool’s description explicit, include when and why to use them.

## LLM-Based Search (vs RAG)

Prefer LLM-driven search over RAG pipelines. Let the agent use native commands (grep, find, regex) to inspect code and text just like a human developer.

## Sub-Agent Strategy

Support one level of branching: the agent can clone itself into a sub-agent for focused tasks. The result is merged back into the main loop as standard tool output.

## Steerability in Practice

Incorporate urgency through clear phrasing (e.g., "PLEASE THIS IS IMPORTANT"). 
Use tags like `<system-reminder>` to reinforce key instructions. 
Include examples in prompts illustrating correct vs incorrect behavior.

## Putting It All Together

```
SYSTEM PROMPT: 
- Tone: Friendly, concise
- Heuristics & Examples: "Use <edit> tool for making code changes; use <read> to ingest file content."
- Tools doc: High-level overview + usage examples
- context file: Load agent.md with user preferences
- Environment info: Date, cwd, recent commits
USER INPUT: 
- Prefaced by agent.md content
- User’s main instruction (e.g., “Refactor this function...”)
AGENT: 
- Decides to run sub-agent or tools
- Uses small model for initial analysis
- Calls appropriate tool with instructions
- Aggregates result, presents to user
```

## Final Thoughts

Simplicity is power: One loop, one message history, minimal branching. Dedicated tools + structured prompts reduce ambiguity and misbehavior. Persistent context (via claude.md or equivalent) dramatically improves personalization and consistency. LLM-driven search avoids complexity and fragility of RAG systems. This template captures the taste of what makes Claude Code such a smooth coding assistant—apply as your baseline and evolve from there.
