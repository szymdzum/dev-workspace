2. **Workflow:** Copy code â†’ Save with Raycast â†’ Process in Obsidian
3. **Organization:** Saved snippets go to Inbox - remember to process them!

## Troubleshooting

### Scripts don't appear in Raycast
- Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
- Restart Raycast or refresh script commands
- Check script directory is added in Raycast settings

### No snippets found
- Check paths in scripts match your Knowledge vault location
- Ensure snippet files exist in Resources/Snippets and Resources/Patterns

### Colors not working
- This is normal in Raycast's UI - colors work in terminal only
- The scripts still function correctly

## Customization

Edit the scripts to customize:
- `KNOWLEDGE_BASE`: Path to your Knowledge vault
- `SNIPPETS_DIR` and `PATTERNS_DIR`: Snippet locations
- File extensions searched (add more in find commands)
