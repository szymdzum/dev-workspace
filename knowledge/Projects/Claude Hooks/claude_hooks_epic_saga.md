# The Claude-Hooks Saga: A TypeScript Developer's Descent Into Shell Script Madness

## The TL;DR (Too Long; Definitely Read)
Built a TypeScript library to validate Claude Code hooks that ended up being a shell script wearing a trenchcoat pretending to be enterprise software. It works. It has tests. It has more documentation than the Apollo program.

## What Actually Exists

### The Code (`libs/claude-hooks/`)
```typescript
HookSystem         // Orchestrates handlers like a symphony conductor on Red Bull
SecureHookBase     // Sanitizes inputs harder than a germaphobe in 2020
HookLogger         // Tracks everything because "trust but verify" is for quitters
SecurityHandler    // Blocks API keys like a bouncer at an exclusive club
```

### The Reality Check
- **Expected**: Claude imports TypeScript modules like a civilized platform
- **Reality**: Claude executes shell scripts with JSON stdin/stdout like it's 1975
- **Solution**: Shell wrappers that call TypeScript because we're not animals

## The Module Resolution Journey (A Tragedy in 4 Acts)

1. **Direct TypeScript**: "Cannot find module" ☠️
2. **Vite Bundle**: Configuration path apocalypse 💥
3. **Webpack**: Complexity overflow exception 🤯
4. **Shell Wrapper**: `#!/bin/bash` - IT WORKS! 🎉

**The Winner**: 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
exec node -r ts-node/register "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/cli/check-secrets.ts"
```
*Because sometimes the dumbest solution is the smartest solution*

## Architecture Patterns That Actually Work

### Pattern 1: The Bridge of Shame
```
User Intent → Claude → Shell Script → TypeScript → Business Logic → JSON → Claude
```
*Each arrow represents 10 hours of debugging*

### Pattern 2: The Security Theater That's Actually Secure
- Blocks OpenAI API keys ✅
- Blocks GitHub tokens ✅
- Blocks JWT tokens ✅
- Blocks your dignity when you hardcode secrets ✅

### Pattern 3: The Configuration Snapshot
Claude freezes config at startup. Changes need `/hooks` review or restart.
**Initial reaction**: "This is broken!"
**Later realization**: "This prevents malicious runtime modifications. GENIUS."

## The Methodology Acronym Collection

Because one framework wasn't enough:
- **DREAM**: Debug like you're interpreting nightmares
- **DECIDE**: Make choices like a CEO with imposter syndrome
- **BUILD**: Construct solutions like IKEA furniture (manual optional)
- **TRACE**: Follow errors like breadcrumbs to your doom

## Enterprise Fever Dreams (The "What If" Section)

Designed theoretical enterprise features nobody asked for:
- **ProjectScaffolder**: "2-hour setup → 30 seconds" (lies)
- **ComplianceValidator**: SOC2 in a hook (auditors hate this one trick)
- **InfrastructureManager**: Terraform from conversation (chaos engineering)
- **CodeIntelligence**: AI testing AI code (Skynet begins)

## Hard-Won Wisdom

### The Environment Is Truth
```typescript
// Your beautiful code:
import { PerfectSolution } from '@imagination/land'

// The environment:
bash: PerfectSolution: command not found
```

### Simple Working > Complex Broken
```bash
# This works:
echo "test" | ./simple.sh

# This doesn't:
npm run build && webpack --config ultra.config.js && pray
```

### Errors Are GPS
"Cannot find module" = Wrong path
"Permission denied" = chmod +x
"Undefined" = You're in shell now, Dorothy

## Testing Strategy (The Pyramid of Hope)
```
       /\
      /  \     Manual Testing (prayer)
     /____\    
    / Unit \   TypeScript Logic (false confidence)
   /  Test  \  
  /___Shell__\ System Testing (reality check)
```

## Anti-Patterns Hall of Shame
- **"It Should Work"**: Narrator: It didn't
- **"Perfect First Try"**: HAHAHAHAHAHA no
- **"Debug By Addition"**: More code = More problems
- **"Assumption Stack"**: Building castles on quicksand

## Quick Reference Commands

### Test Your Hook Manually
```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Write","content":"sk-123"}' | ./check-secrets.sh
# Expected: {"continue":false,"reason":"Nice try, hacker"}
```

### Register With Claude
```bash
# In .claude/settings.json:
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/check-secrets.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Debug When It Inevitably Breaks
```bash
claude --debug  # See what Claude actually executes
/hooks         # Check registration status
```

## The Node.js Situation (PLOT TWIST EDITION)
- **Memory Claims**: v17.0.0 (archaeological artifact)
- **Required**: v18.12+ (from this geological era)
- **ACTUAL REALITY**: v24.6.0 (we're in the FUTURE baby! 🚀)
- **Impact**: Everything probably works now but we're too scared to check

## Project Stats
- **TypeScript Files**: 23 (all pretending to be shell scripts)
- **Documentation**: 2 dissertations + this summary
- **Time Invested**: 47 hours
- **Time Saved Per Hook**: 5 seconds
- **ROI**: Priceless™

## The Real Achievement
Built a production-ready TypeScript framework for piping JSON through bash that:
- Actually works
- Has comprehensive tests
- Blocks real security threats
- Has more documentation than most startups
- Could theoretically run a small country's IT

## Lessons for Next Time
1. Test in the target environment FIRST
2. Shell scripts are the universal adapter
3. Documentation is cheaper than debugging
4. Module resolution will hurt you
5. When in doubt, `#!/bin/bash`

## Bottom Line
We built a Rube Goldberg machine that works, has tests, and enough documentation to warrant its own ISBN. It's TypeScript cosplaying as shell scripts to satisfy an AI that thinks it's 1975.

**Success Metric**: It blocks API keys. Everything else is gravy.
