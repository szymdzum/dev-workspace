# 🚀 Developer
AI-Powered Development Environment with Integrated Knowledge Management

This directory is the central hub for all development proceses.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Developer/
├── Knowledge/
├── Projects/           # 💻 Active project repositories
├── Scripts/            # 🛠️ Automation & utility scripts
├── Configs/            # ⚙️ Shared configurations & dotfiles

```

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Documentation as Code, Knowledge as Power"**

Every piece of code has corresponding documentation. Every project has context. Every decision is recorded. All searchable, linkable, and AI-accessible.

## 📁 Directory Breakdown

### Knowledge/ (Obsidian Vault)
Central knowledge base containing all documentation, notes, and learning materials.

```
Knowledge/
├── Projects/           # Project-specific documentation
│   ├── _active/       # Currently working on
│   ├── _planning/     # Future projects
│   ├── _completed/    # Finished projects
│   └── _templates/    # Project templates
├── Snippets/          # Reusable code snippets by language
├── Notes/             # Daily notes, meetings, ideas
├── Learning/          # Courses, tutorials, experiments
├── Resources/         # Tools, APIs, frameworks docs
└── Templates/         # Document templates
```

### Projects/
Active development repositories with automatic documentation linking.

Each project contains:
- `.claude/` → Symlink to Knowledge/Projects/[project-name]
- `Claude.md` → Main context file for AI assistants
- Standard project files (src/, tests/, etc.)

### Scripts/
Productivity scripts for common tasks:
- `new-project.sh` - Initialize new projects with documentation
- `add-snippet.sh` - Quick snippet capture
- `sync.sh` - Sync knowledge with git
- `search.sh` - Search across all knowledge
- `stats.sh` - Knowledge base statistics

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Claude/Cursor Integration
Every project automatically includes:
```
project/
├── .claude/           # → Links to full project documentation
├── Claude.md          # → Primary context for AI understanding
└── .claude-config/    # → Project-specific AI settings
```

This structure ensures AI assistants always have full context about your project, decisions, and architecture.

### Warp Terminal Integration
```bash
# Quick navigation with Warp's AI
# Type: "go to my project docs"
# Warp understands: cd ~/Developer/Knowledge/Projects/_active/

# Smart commands
# Type: "create new react project with typescript"
# Triggers: ~/Developer/Scripts/new-project.sh my-app --template react-ts
```

## 🚦 Workflow

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# 1. Create project with documentation
./Scripts/new-project.sh awesome-app

# 2. Navigate to project
cd Projects/awesome-app

# 3. Start coding with full AI context
cursor .  # or code .
```

### Daily Development Flow
```bash
# Morning: Check your notes
obsidian ~/Developer/Knowledge

# Coding: Work in project with AI assistance
cd ~/Developer/Projects/current-project
cursor .

# Document: Capture learnings
./Scripts/add-snippet.sh javascript "useful pattern"

# Evening: Sync everything
./Scripts/sync.sh
```

### Knowledge Management
```bash
# Search everything
./Scripts/search.sh "react hooks"

# View statistics
./Scripts/stats.sh

# Quick note
echo "## $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> Knowledge/Notes/daily/today.md
```

## 📚 Knowledge Organization

### Project Documentation Structure
Each project in Knowledge/Projects/ contains:
```

├── README.md          # Overview, setup, architecture
├── DECISIONS.md       # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
├── API.md            # API documentation
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md # Common issues & solutions
├── CHANGELOG.md      # Version history
└── meetings/         # Related meeting notes
```

### Snippet Organization
```
Snippets/
├── javascript/       # JS patterns & utilities
├── typescript/       # TS types & interfaces
├── react/           # Hooks & components
├── python/          # Scripts & functions
├── shell/           # Bash utilities
└── [language]/      # Organized by language
```

### Note Types
```
Notes/
├── daily/           # Daily journals & logs
├── meetings/        # Meeting notes & action items
├── ideas/           # Project ideas & brainstorming
├── reviews/         # Code reviews & retrospectives
└── decisions/       # Technical decisions & rationale
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Setup
Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
# Developer environment
export DEVELOPER_HOME="$HOME/Developer"
export PATH="$DEVELOPER_HOME/Scripts:$PATH"

# Quick aliases
alias dev="cd $DEVELOPER_HOME"
alias projects="cd $DEVELOPER_HOME/Projects"
alias knowledge="cd $DEVELOPER_HOME/Knowledge"
alias new-project="$DEVELOPER_HOME/Scripts/new-project.sh"
alias search-knowledge="$DEVELOPER_HOME/Scripts/search.sh"

# Function for quick project access
proj() {
    cd "$DEVELOPER_HOME/Projects/$1"
}

# Function for quick documentation access
docs() {
    cd "$DEVELOPER_HOME/Knowledge/Projects/_active/$1"
}
```

### Git Configuration
```bash
# Initialize knowledge base repository
cd ~/Developer/Knowledge
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial knowledge base"

# Setup auto-sync (optional)
git remote add origin [your-repo-url]
```

### Obsidian Setup

## 🤝 AI Assistant Context

This directory structure is optimized for AI pair programming:

1. **Automatic Context**: AI sees all project documentation via `.claude/`
2. **Decision History**: AI understands past architectural decisions
3. **Code Patterns**: AI can reference your snippet library
4. **Project Standards**: AI follows your documented conventions

## 📈 Best Practices

1. **Document First**: Write documentation before or during coding
2. **Atomic Commits**: Both code and documentation together
3. **Link Liberally**: Connect related concepts in Obsidian
4. **Template Everything**: Use templates for consistency
5. **Review Regularly**: Keep documentation current
6. **Share Knowledge**: Make discoveries accessible

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Symlinks not working?
```bash
# Recreate symlinks for a project
cd ~/Developer/Projects/my-project
ln -sf ../../Knowledge/Projects/_active/my-project .claude
ln -sf ../../Knowledge/Projects/_active/my-project/README.md Claude.md
```

### Can't find something?
```bash
# Search everywhere
find ~/Developer -name "*keyword*" -type f
# Or use the search script
./Scripts/search.sh "keyword"
```

### Obsidian not syncing?
```bash
cd ~/Developer/Knowledge
git add .
git commit -m "Manual sync"
git push
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start**: Create your first project with documentation
2. **Build**: Develop with AI assistance using full context
3. **Document**: Capture decisions and learnings as you go
4. **Share**: Push knowledge to git for team access
5. **Iterate**: Refine templates based on what works

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- [ ] Automated documentation generation from code
- [ ] AI-powered snippet suggestions
- [ ] Project template marketplace
- [ ] Knowledge graph visualization
- [ ] Automated weekly reports
- [ ] Integration with issue trackers

## 📜 License & Usage

This structure is open for adaptation. Customize it to fit your workflow, team needs, and project requirements.

---

**Remember**: The power isn't in the structure—it's in consistently using it. Every project documented, every snippet saved, every decision recorded makes you and your AI assistants more effective.

*Built for developers who treat knowledge as a first-class citizen of their development process.*
